\section{Conclusion}

This dissertation has explored the development of an Mixed-Reality-assisted, Digital Twin-enabled robot collaborative system with human-in-the-loop control. The primary objective consisted on enhancing Human-Robot Collaboration by integrating advanced technologies that bridge the gap between physical and virtual environments supporting remote collaboration and, thereby, fostering more efficient and intuitive interactions in manufacturing settings.

\textbf{On-Site interaction} was a crucial aspect of the project. By utilizing Handheld Devices such as tablets and smartphones, on-site participants are able to share live views of their surroundings. Furthermore, augmented reality elements were layed upon the mixed-reality application to provide visual and audio cues to the user and enhance the robot's movements awareness. 

In terms of \textbf{remote visualization and interaction}, a foundational 2D interface was accessible via standard devices like laptops. This interface enabled remote participants to visualize the collaboration scenario and understand the task context effectively. Furthermore, the system's capabilities allow remote operation of the robot through the \ac{MR} application, given that bi-directional communication was implemented. This enhancement empowered remote users to interact with and manipulate the collaborative environment, bringing them closer to the on-site experience, aiming to improve the overall collaborative efficacy.


% The camera mounted on top of the robot also allowed to share live-feed of the workspace, therefore successfully enabling dynamic and real-time collaboration with the robot within the designated environment. 
% This approach allowed remote collaborators to gain a comprehensive understanding of the collaborative space, enhancing situational awareness and facilitating better coordination.

*TODO: make sure it is always stated as automation and immersion
Regarding \textbf{automation and immersion}, a camera was mounted on the robot to automate the process of environment sharing with remote participants. This feature relieved on-site participants from the responsibility of manually sharing visual information, as the robot could now autonomously provide live feeds of the workspace. This automation not only improved efficiency but also enhanced the immersive experience for remote users by offering real-time visual insights into the operational environment.

Throughout the development process, we leveraged the Unity game engine for robot model development and employed the Robot Operating System for seamless communication between the physical robot and its digital twin. The use of Vuforia facilitated precise pose registration, ensuring accurate alignment between virtual and physical models. By integrating both visual and audio cues as well as intuitive controls within the shared environment, we enhanced user awareness of the robot's movements and provided a user-friendly interface for robot manipulation.


In conclusion, the project successfully met its defined objectives by creating a system that enhances Human-Robot Collaboration through advanced Mixed-Reality and Digital Twin technologies, focusing on the remote member capabilities. Integrating these technologies resulted in a more intuitive, efficient, and safe collaborative environment, aligning with the core values of Industry 5.0. This proposed system demonstrates significant potential for improving manufacturing processes by combining human expertise with robotic precision, ultimately contributing to more flexible and human-centric industrial practices.

\section{Future Work}

Despite having achieved its primary goals, there are several areas for future exploration to further enhance the system's capabilities and impact.

In addition to user experience research, future work could focus on:

\begin{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Advanced Interaction Modalities}: Incorporating gesture recognition and voice commands can make the system more accessible and reduce reliance on manual input devices. These modalities can provide a more intuitive control mechanism, especially in environments where traditional input devices are impractical.
    
    \item \textbf{Security and Privacy Measures}: Strengthening encryption and authentication protocols will protect user data and ensure secure communication channels. This is crucial for maintaining trust and compliance with data protection regulations.
\end{itemize}

By pursuing these future developments, the system can significantly improve its effectiveness and user satisfaction. Continuous refinement based on user feedback and technological advancements will contribute to its adoption in various industrial contexts, ultimately enhancing human-robot collaboration and advancing the principles of Industry 5.0.
