% Vuforia is a software platform that enables the creation of \ac{ar} experiences. 
% % Integrated with Unity, a leading platform for developing games and interactive applications, Vuforia simplifies the incorporation 
% of AR into mobile and digital apps. 
% It uses computer vision technologies to recognize and track images and objects in the real world, allowing developers to overlay digital 
% content precisely.

% The marker illustrated in Figure \ref{f:aruco_marker} was selected following initial attempts that yielded inconsistent results when using 
% the laptop's camera, shown in the figure \ref{fig:camera-c922}, to scan the environment. This particular marker demonstrated greater stability, 
% enabling the precise positioning of the digital UR10 model in alignment with the physical surroundings. Consequently, this facilitated the accurate 
% overlay of the digital UR10 model onto the actual UR10e robot, enhancing the integration of virtual and real-world elements.
