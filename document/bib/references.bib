   abstract = {Industry 4.0 brought a new revolution in industries by making them fully automated via innovative technologies, without considering human-power. Industry 4.0 aims to establish 'smart manufacturing industry' by emphasizing on Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IOT), Cyber Physical System (CPS), Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and Robotics. This highly automated industry neglected human's intellectual and cognitive skills, causing an increase in unemployment rate and devastation of ecosystem. In this paper, we proposed a framework of emerging technologies of Industry 5.0. Here, we examined how Industry 5.0 will further extend the development of Industry 4.0 and how humans can contribute to its manufacturing process. In addition, prestigious and significant skills for workforce in manufacturing industry are also explored. We also investigated how the Covid-19 epidemic was associated to Industry 5.0 and the idea of sustainable development goals (SDGs). Finally, we highlighted some of the challenges facing the industrial sector as research direction of Industry 5.0.},

   abstract = {The evolution of intelligent manufacturing has had a profound and lasting effect on the future of global manufacturing. Industry 4.0 based smart factories merge physical and cyber technologies, making the involved technologies more intricate and accurate; improving the performance, quality, controllability, management, and transparency of manufacturing processes in the era of the internet-of-things (IoT). Advanced low-cost sensor technologies are essential for gathering data and utilizing it for effective performance by manufacturing companies and supply chains. Different types of low power/low cost sensors allow for greatly expanded data collection on different devices across the manufacturing processes. While a lot of research has been carried out with a focus on analyzing the performance, processes, and implementation of smart factories, most firms still lack in-depth insight into the difference between traditional and smart factory systems, as well as the wide set of different sensor technologies associated with Industry 4.0. This paper identifies the different available sensor technologies of Industry 4.0, and identifies the differences between traditional and smart factories. In addition, this paper reviews existing research that has been done on the smart factory; and therefore provides a broad overview of the extant literature on smart factories, summarizes the variations between traditional and smart factories, outlines different types of sensors used in a smart factory, and creates an agenda for future research that encompasses the vigorous evolution of Industry 4.0 based smart factories.},

   abstract = {In the past, manufacturing equipment was instrumented hard-wired. Industrial equipment such as sensors, controllers, and others are expensive, and upgrading manufacturing equipment in existing facilities is costly. The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven cost reductions in sensors, controllers, and communications through high volumes of digital devices and value-added components. The manufacturing sector with its massive installed base of legacy equipment has also become an area of interest for the advances in innovative digital technologies. Meanwhile, the next level of innovation in manufacturing has been achieved, labeled by the term 4th Industrial Revolution, in short Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and intelligent production technologies. Machines are connected and communicate with each other to ultimately make decisions, operate independently, or cooperate with humans in a customer-oriented production environment. This raises the question about the key issues of the next industrial enhancement and the term to call it? The change from Industry 4.0 to the next innovative industrial enhancement is termed Industry 5.0. However, Industry 5.0 has its root in the concept of Industry 4.0. Thus, the key issues of the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 can be seen in the goal of making manufacturability sustainable from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. This requires building a circular economy with a focus on a human centric industry. The paper describes the development from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0.},

Much of this investment has been driven by visions such as Industry 4.0, striving to achieve a future where intelligent factories and smart manufacturing are the norm. Within this realm, innovations such as the Industrial Internet of Things, Cloud-based Design and Manufacturing (CBDM), and Social Product Development (SPD) have emerged with a focus on capitalizing on the benefits and economies of scale provided by Internet Protocol (IP) communication technologies. Another emerging idea is the notion of software-defined systems such as software-defined networks, which exploit abstraction and inexpensive hardware advancements in an effort to build more flexible systems. Recently, the authors have begun considering how the notion of software-defined systems might be harnessed to achieve flexible cloud manufacturing systems. As a result, this paper introduces the notion of Software-Defined Cloud Manufacturing (SDCM). We describe a basic SDCM architecture based on leveraging abstraction between manufacturing hardware and cloud-based applications, services, and platforms. The goal of SDCM is to advance Cloud-Based Manufacturing and other Industry 4.0 pillars by providing agility, flexibility, and adaptability while also reducing various complexity challenges.},

DRL takes the advantages of both Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), by embracing the power of representation learning, to make precise and fast decisions when facing dynamic and complex situations. Ever since the first paper of DRL was published in 2013, its applications have sprung up across the manufacturing field with exponential publication growth year by year. However, there still lacks any comprehensive review of the DRL in the field of smart manufacturing. To fill this gap, a systematic review process was conducted, with 261 relevant publications selected to date (20-Oct-2022), to gain a holistic understanding of the development, application, and challenges of DRL in smart manufacturing along the whole engineering lifecycle. First, the concept and development of DRL are summarized. Then, the typical DRL applications are analyzed in the four engineering lifecycle stages: design, manufacturing, distribution, and maintenance. Finally, the challenges and future directions are illustrated, especially emerging DRL-related technologies and solutions that can improve the manufacturing system’s deployment feasibility, cognitive capability, and learning efficiency, respectively. It is expected that this work can provide an insightful guide to the research of DRL in the smart manufacturing field and shed light on its future perspectives.}

   abstract = {A dynamic and flexible manufacturing environment presents many challenges in the movement of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), leading to delays due to the complexity of operations while negotiating even a simple route. Therefore, an understanding of rules related to AMR movement is important both from a utility perspective as well as a safety perspective. Our survey from literature and industry has revealed a gap in methodology to test rules related to AMR movement in a factory environment. Testing purely through simulations would not able to capture the nuances of shop floor interactions whereas physical testing alone would be incredibly time-consuming and potentially hazardous. This work presents a new methodology that can make use of observations of AMR behaviour on selected cases on the shop floor and build up the fidelity of those simulations based on observations. This paper presents the development of a Highway Code for AMRs, development of simulation models for an ideal AMR (based on the rules from the Highway Code), and physical testing of real AMR in an industrial environment. Finally, a behavioural comparison of an ideal AMR and a real AMR in five scenarios (taken from the shop floor of an industrial partner) is presented. This work could enable informed decisions regarding the implementation of AMRs through identification of any adverse behaviours which could then be mitigated either through improvements on the AMR or through establishing shop floor protocols that reduce the potential impact of these behaviours.},

This article starts with an overview of some robotic systems with cutting-edge technologies (sensors and actuators) suitable for pHRC operations and the intelligent assist devices employed in pHRC. Sensors being among the essential components to establish communication between a human and a robotic system are surveyed. The sensor supplies the signal needed to drive the robotic actuators. The survey reveals that the design of new generation collaborative robots and other intelligent robotic systems has paved the way for sophisticated learning techniques and control algorithms to be deployed in pHRC. Furthermore, it revealed the relevant components needed to be considered for effective pHRC to be accomplished. Finally, a discussion of the major advances is made, some research directions, and future challenges are presented.},

abstract = {Smart manufacturing is being shaped nowadays by two different paradigms: Industry 4.0 proclaims transition to digitalization and automation of processes while emerging Industry 5.0 emphasizes human centricity. This turn can be explained by unprecedented challenges being faced recently by societies, such as, global climate change, pandemics, hybrid and conventional warfare, refugee crises. Sustainable and resilient processes require humans to get back into the loop of organizational decision-making. In this paper, we argue that the most reasonable way to marry the two extremes of automation and value-based human-driven processes is to create an Industry 4.0 + Industry 5.0 hybrid, which inherits the most valuable features of both - efficiency of the Industry 4.0 processes and sustainability of the Industry 5.0 decisions. Digital cognitive clones twinning human decision-making behavior are represented as an enabling technology for the future hybrid and as an accelerator (as well as resilience enabler) of the convergence of the digital and human worlds.}

ABSTRACT = {Staying at the top is getting tougher and more challenging due to the fast-growing and changing digital technologies and AI-based solutions. The world of technology, mass customization, and advanced manufacturing is experiencing a rapid transformation. Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain–machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away.},

abstract = {What is Mixed Reality (MR)? To revisit this question given the many recent developments, we conducted interviews with ten AR/VR experts from academia and industry, as well as a literature survey of 68 papers. We find that, while there are prominent examples, there is no universally agreed on, one-size-fits-all definition of MR. Rather, we identified six partially competing notions from the literature and experts' responses. We then started to isolate the different aspects of reality relevant for MR experiences, going beyond the primarily visual notions and extending to audio, motion, haptics, taste, and smell. We distill our findings into a conceptual framework with seven dimensions to characterize MR applications in terms of the number of environments, number of users, level of immersion, level of virtuality, degree of interaction, input, and output. Our goal with this paper is to support classification and discussion of MR applications' design and provide a better means to researchers to contextualize their work within the increasingly fragmented MR landscape.},

abstract = {In the Industry 4.0 era, the Digital Twin (DT), virtual copies of the system that are able to interact with the physical counterparts in a bi-directional way, seem to be promising enablers to replicate production systems in real time and analyse them. A DT should be capable to guarantee well-defined services to support various activities such as monitoring, maintenance, management, optimization and safety. Through an analysis of the current picture of manufacturing and a literature review about the already existing DT environment, this paper identifies what is still missing in the implemented DT to be compliant to their description in literature. Particular focuses of this paper are the degree of integration of the proposed DT with the control of the physical system, in particular with the Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) when the production system is based on the Automation Pyramid, and the services offered from these environments, comparing them to the reference ones. This paper proposes also a practical implementation of a DT in a MES equipped assembly laboratory line of the School of Management of the Politecnico di Milano. The application has been created to pose the basis to overcome the missing implementation aspects found in literature. In such a way, the developed DT paves the way for future research to close the loop between the MES and the DT taking into consideration the number of services that a DT could offer in a single environment.}

A general DT for complex equipment is first constructed, then a new method using DT driven PHM is proposed, making effective use of the interaction mechanism and fused data of DT. A case study of a wind turbine is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Instead of walking to each patient's bedside to collect vital information, nurses can collect it in one location and concentrate their efforts on caring for those who need them the most. As an outcome of these requirements, a prospect arose to design a highly efficient patient care and monitoring system which can handle patients and multiple parametric measurements from every single patient in real time. Patient care and monitoring embedded systems are proposed in this work to acquire, store, display physiological information obtained from multi patients and are vital in operating rooms, emergency rooms, intensive care units, ambulances as well as at homes.

abstract  = {Robotic welding demands high accuracy and precision. However, robot programming is often a tedious and time-consuming process that requires expert knowledge. This paper presents an augmented reality assisted robot welding task programming (ARWP) system using a user-friendly augmented reality (AR) interface that simplifies and speeds up the programming of robotic welding tasks. The ARWP system makes the programming of robot welding tasks more user-friendly and reduces the need for trained programmers and expertise in specific robotic systems. The AR interface simplifies the definition of a welding path as well as the welding gun orientation, and the system; the system can locate the welding seam of a workpiece quickly and generate a viable welding path based on the user input. The developed system is integrated with the touch-sensing capability of welding robots in order to locate the welding path accurately based on the user input, for fillet welding. The system is applicable to other welding processes and methods of seam localization. The system implementation is described and evaluated with a case study.}

abstract = {The teleoperation and coordination of multiple industrial robots play an important role in today’s industrial internet-based collaborative manufacturing systems. The user-friendly teleoperation approach allows operators from different manufacturing domains to reduce redundant learning costs and intuitively control the robot in advance. Nevertheless, only a few preliminary works have been introduced very recently, let alone its effective implementation in the manufacturing scenarios. To address the gap, this research proposes a novel multi-robot collaborative manufacturing system with human-in-the-loop control by leveraging the cutting-edge augmented reality (AR) and digital twin (DT) techniques. In the proposed system, the DTs of industrial robots are firstly mapped to physical robots and visualize them in the AR glasses. Meanwhile, a multi-robot communication mechanism is designed and implemented, to synchronize the state of robots in the twin. Moreover, a reinforcement learning algorithm is integrated into the robot motion planning to replace the conventional kinematics-based robot movement with corresponding target positions. Finally, three interactive AR-assisted DT modes, including real-time motion control, planned motion control, and robot monitoring mode are generated, which can be readily switched by human operators. Two experimental studies are conducted on (1) a single robot with a commonly used peg-in-hole experiment, and (2) the motion planning of multi-robot collaborative tasks, respectively. From the experimental results, it can be found that the proposed system can well handle the multi-robot teleoperation tasks with high efficiency and owns great potentials to be adopted in other complicated manufacturing scenarios in the near future.}

abstract = {This paper presents an Augmented Reality (AR) application that aims to facilitate the operator’s work in an industrial, human-robot collaboration environment with mobile robots. In such a flexible environment, with robots and humans working and moving in the same area, the ease of communication between the two sides is critical and prerequisite. The developed application provides the user with handy tools to interact with the mobile platform, give direct instructions to it and receive information about the robot’s and the broader system’s state, through an AR headset. The communication between the headset and the robot is achieved through a ROS based system, that interconnects the resources. The discussed tool has been deployed and tested in a use case inspired from the automotive industry, assisting the operators during the collaborative assembly tasks.}

However, the need of adaptability and the dynamics of human presence are keeping the full potential of human-robot collaborative systems difficult to achieve. This paper explores the opportunities of using a digital twin to address the complexity of collaborative production systems through an industrial case and a demonstrator. A digital twin, as a virtual counterpart of a physical human-robot assembly system, is built as a ‘front-runner’ for validation and control throughout its design, build and operation. The forms of digital twins along system's life cycle, its building blocks and the potential advantages are presented and discussed. Recommendations for future research and practice in the use of digital twins in the field of cobotics are given.}

ABSTRACT = {This paper provides an overview of collaborative robotics towards manufacturing applications. Over the last decade, the market has seen the introduction of a new category of robots—collaborative robots (or “cobots”)—designed to physically interact with humans in a shared environment, without the typical barriers or protective cages used in traditional robotics systems. Their potential is undisputed, especially regarding their flexible ability to make simple, quick, and cheap layout changes; however, it is necessary to have adequate knowledge of their correct uses and characteristics to obtain the advantages of this form of robotics, which can be a barrier for industry uptake. The paper starts with an introduction of human–robot collaboration, presenting the related standards and modes of operation. An extensive literature review of works published in this area is undertaken, with particular attention to the main industrial cases of application. The paper concludes with an analysis of the future trends in human–robot collaboration as determined by the authors.},

title = "Cobots: robots for collaboration with human operators",
abstract = "A 'cobot' is a robotic device which manipulates objects in collaboration with a human operator. A cobot provides assistance to the human operator by setting up virtual surfaces which can be used to constrain and guide motion. While conventional servo-actuated haptic displays may be used in this way also, an important distinction is that, while haptic displays are active devices which can supply energy to the human operator, cobots are intrinsically passive. This is because cobots do not use servos to implement constraint, but instead employ 'steerable' nonholonomic joints. As a consequence of their passivity, cobots are potentially well-suited to safety-critical tasks (e.g. surgery) or those which involve large interaction forces (e.g. automobile assembly). This paper focuses on the simplest possible cobot, which has only a single joint (a steerable wheel). Two control modes of this 'unicycle cobot', termed 'virtual caster' and 'virtual wall' control, are developed in detail. Experimental results are also presented.",

Based on the assembly process specifications, different control, safety and operator support strategies have to be implemented in order for the human safety and the overall system's productivity to be ensured. The variability of assembly processes (screwing, insertion, fixing etc.), components (small/big/flexible parts), robotic equipment (single arm, dual arm, overhead) and station layouts, dictates different approaches, in terms of human-robot interaction. Enabling technologies involve safety sensors for real time workspace supervision, certified robot control safe functionalities as well as systems for the operator's better integration into the collaborative environment via Augmented Reality and web services. The application of such concepts is examined in three pilot cases.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to a wide spectrum of industrial sectors, but manual operations remain indispensable in most manufacturing systems due to high complexity or costs involving in automation. A more practical approach is enabling humans to collaborate with machines complementary to each other. One critical issue in human-robot collaboration (HRC) is to assure the operator's productivity, safety, and trust while interacting with the robot. This paper presents an experimental study on user interface design in augmented reality (AR) for human-robot collaborative assembly in a shared workspace. The experiment aims to verify and cross-compare the effectiveness of visual and haptic cues in various forms that convey the robot intent to human. Analysis of the work performance and gazing behavior of participants shows that both cues can reduce their visual attention on the moving robot during the collaboration. The interface that provides the proximity of robot using visual cues is considered most useful. It is not intuitive to recognize complex information by vibration on different parts of the human hand in the experiment. Finally, human trust to robot has a higher correlation on the usability of a user interface than the work performance assisted by the interface. These findings may work as design guidelines for AR assisted human-robot interaction in smart manufacturing.}
